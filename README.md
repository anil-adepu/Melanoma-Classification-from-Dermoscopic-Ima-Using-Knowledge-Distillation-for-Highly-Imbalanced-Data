Official code for the paper: [Melanoma classification from dermatoscopy images using knowledge distillation for highly imbalanced data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523000367) published in [Computers in Biology and Medicine, Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com/locate/compbiomed)


**TL;DR** Melanoma classification task is challenging due to the high inter-class and low intra-class similarity problems in dermoscopic image datasets. The work proposes a novel knowledge-distilled lightweight Deep-CNN-based framework to tackle the high inter-class and low intra-class similarity problems with Knowledge Distillation, Cost-Sensitive Learning with Focal Loss for addressing class imbalance to achieve better sensitivity scores.
