**TL;DR** Melanoma classification task is challenging due to the high inter-class and low intra-class similarity problems in dermoscopic image datasets. The work proposes a novel knowledge-distilled lightweight Deep-CNN-based framework to tackle the high inter-class and low intra-class similarity problems with Knowledge Distillation, Cost-Sensitive Learning with Focal Loss for addressing class imbalance to achieve better sensitivity scores.
